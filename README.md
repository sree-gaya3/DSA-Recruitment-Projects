###### _Website for the NITK_Winter_of_Code_   [NITK_WOC](NITK_WOC)

***************

### Task_Id : NITK_Virtual_Guide
###### _App = NITK_Virtual Guide_   [Virtual_NITK](Virtual_NITK)

#### Here is my timeline

- **28th September**: Searching for the tasks that I want to do in the coming week.
- **29th September**: Selected NITK_Virtual_Guide as the task I am going to do, because I am learning kotlin language for android development so, I thought I can try doing this.
- **30th September - 3rd October**: Worked seriously on the App. My Progress in this task can be seen here. And also the reason why I stopped this task is .
- **4th October**: I Stopped The Android Development and started Web Development. I know HTML but have 0 knowledge in CSS and Javascript. I just know HTML, but not tried to create a website before. I thought, "it's ok, I will do how much I can by the deadline, but i will try the app and make my website more advanced than the time of submission."
- **4th October - 6th October**: I Started working on the website. I am learning CSS and Javascript and using the things I learnt, I made a mock-website, which is not at all related to this, just to improve my confidence and habituate to the environment. I created the actual website but have to make some changes related to styling and make my website responsive.
- **7th October**: First, I learned how to host a website in github and hosted my website, because I also want to see how my website actually works on tab, mobile. Then, I started working on making my website responsive.

## One mistake I realized that i have done in this process is, not updating git repo.
***This is because when i started creating website, I read that we can use github to host our website and read the process. In that process, there are some conditions on the name of repo, position od index.html and soon. In the instructions it is mentioned that "if you are working on two projects, create a common repo with two projects as different folders. I got confused, and I thought that i can create the repo once I completed the website. But, today i thought that we can create a repo for hosting and different repo combining both the projects. This is what happened with me!!!***
