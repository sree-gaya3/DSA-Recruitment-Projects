### _This is the website I created for NITK Winter of Code in the process of DSC Recritments._

#### I am very much happy to complete this website and present it to you. This is the result of my 4-full day hardwork which you aall can see, but the result which only me can see is more than this. I am very much satisfied by completing this project. I learnt many things which includes CSS, JS, Organizing code, managing time, self-confidence and many. I made one more website for trial before this and finally made this. I hosted my website on github and This is my First Website!!!
