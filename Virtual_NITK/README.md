#### I have started this task first. I am just learning kotlin, and for me this task seems like an app woth various segments and all. I thought i coulld complete the app by learning kotlin. Because of my less knowledge on kotlin and no knowledge in java, it became very tough task for me. Still without stopping i continued my work, and the came a problem for which I cannot find the solution even now. 

###### I got an idea that implementing one more module that tells the working hours of each place in NITK, because generally as a student I faced this issue many times.

_**That is:** I know that using fragments is good for creating a navigation bar and successfully created it. but, I donot know the full functionality of fragments as like activities. For the idea mentioned above, I created a recycler view and succesfully implemented this module. but I did all that in an activityh in different project, and I got stuck with all the errors raising when I am trying to implement the same in fragment. I tried to find the solution for one whole day, and then I decided to start working on another project._
